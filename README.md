# Manitoba Soil Viability Prediction

An MLOps project for predicting soil agricultural capability in Manitoba using gradient boosting models.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict soil viability for farming in Manitoba based on the Manitoba soil dataset. It implements a complete MLOps pipeline for model development, training, evaluation, and deployment.

### Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for soil characteristics
- XGBoost classification model for predicting agricultural capability
- MLflow experiment tracking and model versioning
- Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna and Bayesian methods
- Streamlit web application for interactive predictions
- Containerized deployment with Docker

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)
