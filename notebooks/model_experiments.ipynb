    "# Soil Viability Prediction: Model Experimentation with XGBoost and MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to experiment with various configurations of the XGBoost model to predict soil viability for farming in Manitoba. The notebook will leverage MLflow to:\n",
    "- Track and log experiments, including hyperparameters, metrics, and model artifacts.\n",
    "- Facilitate reproducibility and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Workflow Outline**\n",
    "1. **Setup and Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Import necessary libraries.\n",
    "   - Initialize MLflow for experiment tracking.\n",
    "2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Load and process the Manitoba soil dataset using the `DataProcessor` class.\n",
    "   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) if needed.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Apply transformations to create features such as `MANCON` flags, weighted scores, and encoded classifications.\n",
    "4. **Model Experimentation**:\n",
    "   - Train XGBoost models with various hyperparameter configurations.\n",
    "   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy).\n",
    "   - Log experiments to MLflow.\n",
    "5. **Analysis of Results**:\n",
    "   - Compare model performance across experiments.\n",
    "   - Visualize feature importance and residuals.\n",
    "6. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - Choose the best-performing model based on metrics logged in MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tools and Technologies**\n",
    "- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework for training models.\n",
    "- **MLflow**: A platform for managing machine learning experiments, including:\n",
    "  - Tracking hyperparameters and metrics.\n",
    "  - Logging models and artifacts for reproducibility.\n",
    "  - Visualizing experiment results.\n",
    "- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.\n",
    "- **DataProcessor**: Custom class for data preprocessing and feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Expected Outcomes**\n",
    "By the end of this notebook:\n",
    "- You will have a trained and evaluated XGBoost model.\n",
    "- All experiments will be tracked and logged in MLflow, enabling easy comparison and reproducibility.\n",
    "- Insights into the most influential features for predicting soil viability will be generated.\n",
